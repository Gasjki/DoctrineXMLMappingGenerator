# Doctrine XML Mapping Generator

Because annotation are not recommended anymore starting with PHP 7.x and YAML is not a friendly syntax due indentation, XML becomes the only way to declare database tables based on entities.
XML is not a complex language to work with, but it can be tricky and discouraging for most new users, but **the idea of this tool is to provide a simple way to generate your mapping.**
